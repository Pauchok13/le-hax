Le Hax - Hackathon Project - School Simplified Hackathon - Learning

**###A Learning Opportunity**

**### What it has:**
A music function, kick/ban/unban, ranking system, and a message purge function.

**###How we built it**
We built it using discord.py. We as a team have very limited coding knowledge so we used this as a catalyst to learn.

**###Challenges we ran into**
We ran into a lot of what you could say would be "rookie" mistakes. We had trouble debugging because we weren't too familiar with the errors as well as the language.

**###Accomplishments that we're proud of**
Overall we're really proud of the whole thing because it was really our first time doing anything like this. I'd say the thing we're the proudest of though, is just getting it done.

**###What we learned**
We learned a lot. Most of all, how to use the internet as a tool to help you learn and grow. We learned how to work together as a programming team and how we could better organize ourselves next time.

**###What's next for Discord Multi-Purpose Bot**
As it stands now, we are probably going to continue working on this bot to further our knowledge of discord.py. we hear a lot from those who have been doing this for years that "A stupid project is all you need to learn." so that's our plan. Work on a stupid project to learn more!
